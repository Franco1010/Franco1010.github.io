I'm an student in computing engineer in Universidad de Guadalajara in the Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierias that is located in Jalisco, Mexico.
I have an strong enthusiasm for compete in programming and math challenges, I love to solve problems and also train and encourage other people to do it too.
